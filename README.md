# CarPricePredictor
I built some models back in January to predict car prices to help me buy a car for myself. 

## Goals
The goal of the project was to learn more about cars by drawing insight using trends found with AI. Not only was this accomplished and I learned what people found important in cars, but I also learned more about AI using cars.

## Outcomes
I learned that deep learning neural networks are wonderful for coming up with new ideas that they've never seen before. However, it's extremely difficult to beat something like a decision tree machine learning algorithm when it comes to tabular data.

## Future
In the future of this project it would be good to give it more data (different brands, more models, etc.). I would also like to eventually incorporate computer vision to be able to see the car and factor in the value.
