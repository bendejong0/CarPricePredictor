# CarPricePredictor
I built some models back in January to predict car prices to help me buy a car for myself. 

## Goals
The goal of the project was to learn more about cars by drawing insight using trends found with AI. Not only was this accomplished and I learned what people found important in cars, but I also learned more about AI using cars.

## Methods
Initially, I tinkered with a MLP model to fine tune it and get the most accurate result. Later, I wanted to compare it to a decision tree regressor algorithm. The decision tree algorithm blew the MLP out of the water. I researched this and discovered it was because decision tree algorithms are extremely good with structured, tabular data, whereas deep learning algorithms are much better at unstructured data with complicated relationships. I will factor this into future projects.

Later, I wanted to verify the accuracy of my model, or see how they would compare if they had larger data sets. So I found a dataset on Kaggle and created a model. The models all agreed on the prices of the car to a satisfactory point, and I concluded my models were accurate.

## Outcomes
I learned that deep learning neural networks are wonderful for coming up with new ideas that they've never seen before. However, it's extremely difficult to beat something like a decision tree machine learning algorithm when it comes to tabular data.

## Future
In the future of this project it would be good to give it more data (different brands, more models, etc.). I would also like to eventually incorporate computer vision to be able to see the car and factor in the value.
